1. 自我介绍
  大家好我叫Chen Bing Wei，我以前只有學習過往佔前後都開發，從未接觸solidity與smart contract這類的東西，但今年因緣際會下修了一門叫分散式金融導論的課，助教教的非常好，讓我對這個領域充滿極大的興趣，或許未來可以做跨領域的結合，結合網路服務，金融科技，與機器學習等現在所學的知識，創造出能對人類有所貢獻的東西，因此想藉由這次機會挑戰自己，參加此次活動逼迫自己學習。

2. 你认为你会完成本次残酷学习吗？

#### WTF is Solidity?
- Solidity is a programming language used for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Solidity has two characteristics:
  1. **Object-oriented**: After learning it, you can use it to make money by finding the right projects.
  2. **Advanced**: If you can write smart contract in Solidity, you are the first class citizen of Ethereum.

#### Development tool: Remix
Remix is an smart contract development IDE (Integrated Development Environment) recommended by Ethereum official.
- Advantages
  1. **Suitable for Beginners**: It allows for quick deployment and testing of smart contracts in the browser, without needing to install any programs on your local machine.
  2. **Gas Estimation Issue**: It will estimation the cost of gas on every functions and display behind them, which can remind developers that wheter functions should be optimized or not.
- Disadvantages
  1. **Limited to Browser**: Since Remix is a browser-based IDE, it can be less stable or responsive compared to desktop IDEs like VSCode, especially when working with larger projects or multiple open files.
  2. **Collaboration Limitations**: Remix doesn’t have built-in features for real-time collaboration or version control like Git, making it more difficult to work in teams.

#### The first Solidity program

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
contract HelloWeb3 {
    string public _string = "Hello Web3!";
}
```
1. The first line is a comment, which denotes the software license (license identifier) used by the program. We are using the MIT license. **If you do not indicate the license used, the program can compile successfully but will report an warning during compilation**. Solidity's comments are denoted with "//", followed by the content of the comment (which will not be run by the program). Details can be found in the [SPDX-License
documentation](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
2. The second line declares the **Solidity version** used by the source file, because the syntax of different versions is different. This line of code means that the source file will not allow compilation by compilers version **lower than v0.8.4 and not higher than v0.9.0** [0.8.4, 0.9.0).
  - There is slight difference among distinct
versions: 0.4.22 -> constructor, 0.8.0 -> safeMath
  - Include the pragma version in every file: Locking the version is preferable, except for libraries.
  - Pattern: pragma solidity x.y.z: e.g. **pragma solidity ^0.8.3 : [0.8.3, 0.9.0)** or **pragma solidity >=0.8.3 <0.8.7**
3. Lines 3 and 4 are the main body of the smart contract. Line 3 creates a contract with the name `HelloWeb3`. Line 4 is the content of the contract. Here, we created a string variable called _string and assign "Hello Web3!" as value to it.

#### Summary
In the first day, I learned what is `Solidity`, `Remix IDE`, and completed our first Solidity program - `HelloWeb3`.

#### Variable Types
Solidity is statically-type language, which means **the type of each variable needs to be specified in code at compile time**.

1. **Value Type**： This include boolean, integer, etc. These variables directly pass values when assigned.
2. **Reference Type**：including arrays and structures. These variables take up more space, directly pass addresses (similar to pointers) when assigned, and can be modified with multiple variable names.
3. **Mapping Type**: hash tables in Solidity.

#### 1. Value Type

| Type  | Example | Byte  | Default Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Boolean | `true` / `false` | 1 Byte | False |
| Usigned Integer | `uint128`, `uint256` | uint256 - 32 bytes | 0 |
| Integer | `int128`, `int256` | int256 - 32 bytes | 0 |
| address* / adress payable* | `address public _address = 0x5C69...5aA6` | 20 bytes | address(0) |
| Fixed-Sized bytes array | `bytes32 public _byte32 = "MiniSolidity";` `bytes1 public _byte = _byte32[0];` | bytes32 - 32 bytes | bytes32(0) |
| Enumeration | `enum ActionSet { Buy, Hold, Sell }` | uint 0,  1,  2 | - |

*address payable: Same as address, but with the additional members transfer and send to allow ETH transfers.

*There are two types of accounts: EOA & CA
- EOA(Externally Owned Account): For example, Wallet Address
- CA(Contract Account): For example, Simple Bank Contract

#### 2. Reference Type

| Type  | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Array | `uint256[], string, bytes (Dynamic Size Bytes Array)` |
| Struct | `struct Demo {uint256 x, uint256 y}` |

#### 3. Mapping Type

| Type  | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Mapping | `mapping(address=>uint256)`, `mapping(address addr=>uint)`, `mapping(address addr=>uint balance)` |
